## Motivation behind
To facilitate our paper writing, we may usually need to download and copy the latex source code of other's paper. However, this process can become very tedious if there are many papers to download. So I develop this tool to automate this process. I implement it simply with `request` and `tarfile`. To make it as services, I push this project online with the help of `Streamlit` and `Herokuapp`.

## To-do
- [ ] Unlimit download paper number (Solution to download large zip file with streamlit)
